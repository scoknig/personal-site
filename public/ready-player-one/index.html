<p>As I&rsquo;m putting the finishing touches on this site, I&rsquo;m also thinking back on the graveyard of &ldquo;personal sites past&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve left behind over the years.</p>
<p>Since the dawn of the internet, there&rsquo;s been an unspoken peer pressure to create a &ldquo;digital presence&rdquo; where people can find you online (doubly so for developers). For most people these days, social media fills this void. I&rsquo;ve never really been thrilled with social media and, while I have accounts on a few platforms, I post <em>maybe</em> a couple times per year at most.</p>
<p>A more useful thing to have is a place to keep ideas, resources, and other sundry tidbits that I may want to look back on later. In recent years I&rsquo;ve come across Tiago Forte&rsquo;s idea of building a <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/">second brain</a>. The only issue is that I can&rsquo;t figure out what type of person has the time or attention to maintaining such a detailed thing.</p>
<p>Certainly not me.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the principles of <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> are hard to argue against. Why create content on someone else&rsquo;s platform when I can just put everything I want here as a single source of truth for all my online content?</p>
<p>You may have also noticed that the design here is brutally minimal. That&rsquo;s also <a href="https://thewebisfucked.com/">intentional</a>. In past projects, there&rsquo;s always been another platform to upgrade, a code library to update, yada yada yada. With the goal of avoiding that rigmarole here, this site will remain content-focused. It&rsquo;s beauty is in its simplicity. Like the creator of <a href="https://512kb.club">the 512K Club</a> states, the internet has become a <strong>bloated mess</strong>, and I don&rsquo;t intend to contribute to that trend.</p>
<p>The more you get carried away with shiny libraries and tools, the more technical debt you create for yourself. Keep it simple. I&rsquo;m aiming to do just that, while paying homage to the barebones-yet-nostalgic sites of Web 1.0.</p>
<p>Thanks to my former colleague <code>zwbetz</code> and his detailed <a href="https://zwbetz.com/make-a-hugo-blog-from-scratch/">intro to Hugo</a>, I was able to set this up quickly and intend to keep it running as one of the most lightweight sites around.</p>
