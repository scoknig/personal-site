<p>As I&rsquo;m putting the finishing touches on this site, I&rsquo;m also thinking back on the graveyard of &ldquo;personal sites past&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve left behind over the years.</p>
<p>Since the dawn of the internet there&rsquo;s been an unspoken peer pressure to create a &ldquo;digital presence&rdquo; where people can find you online (doubly so for developers). For most people these days, social media fills this void. However, I&rsquo;ve never really felt the pull of social media and, while I have accounts on a few platforms, post <em>maybe</em> a couple times per year.</p>
<p>A more useful thing to have, at least where I&rsquo;m concerned, is a place to keep ideas, resources, and other random tidbits that I may want to look back on later. In recent years I&rsquo;ve come across Tiago Forte&rsquo;s idea of building a <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/">second brain</a>. The only issue there is I can&rsquo;t figure out what type of person (psychopath?) has the time or attention to maintaining such a detailed thing.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the principles of <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> are hard to argue against. Why create content on someone else&rsquo;s platform? I&rsquo;ll just put everything I want here as a single source of truth for all my online content.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s where this site comes in. This won&rsquo;t be a blog in the traditional sense. I won&rsquo;t be publishing anything on a regular schedule, and it won&rsquo;t be for a particular audience. I&rsquo;ll be writing about things that I find interesting and/or useful, and there may be times when I&rsquo;ll go months without posting anything new.</p>
<p>You may have also noticed is that the design here is minimal to the point of having no design at all. That&rsquo;s also <a href="https://thewebisfucked.com/">intentional</a>.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned, through the years I&rsquo;ve gone through <em>many</em> iterations of finding a new platform, creating a new personal site/blog/whatever with the best intentions, and then months later archiving it. Rinse, lather, repeat.</p>
<p>The only way this is going to work is if I set this baby up and let her run with the least possible amount of maintenance required. Not only that, but like the creator of <a href="https://512kb.club">the 512K Club</a> states, the internet has become a <strong>bloated mess</strong>, and I don&rsquo;t feel the need to contribute to that trend.</p>
<p>In past projects, there&rsquo;s always another platform to upgrade, a code library to update, yada yada yada.</p>
<p>Thanks to my former colleague <code>zwbetz</code> and his fantastic <a href="https://zwbetz.com/make-a-hugo-blog-from-scratch/">intro to Hugo</a>, I was able to set this up quickly and intend to keep it running as one of the most lightweight sites around.</p>
<p>You might be thinking to yourself, <em>why is this site so ugly?</em> Is it? If you&rsquo;ve paid attention so far, you&rsquo;ll have realized this site is heavily content-focused and will stay that way. It&rsquo;s beauty is in its simplicity.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the more you get carried away with shiny libraries and tools, the more technical debt you create for yourself. Keep it simple. I&rsquo;m aiming to do just that, while paying homage to the barebones-yet-somehow-nostalgic sites of Web 1.0.</p>
<p>So, to kick things off in the spirit of that era: <code>Ready Player One</code></p>
