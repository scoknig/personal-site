Here's a few things I'm currently working on:

- [This website](/tools/)

- [Building my home lab](/linux-poll/) to experiment with new (to me) tech

- Learning [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) to program microcontrollers and build cool electronics projects (more on that soon)

- [Using data](http://www.markwk.com/data-analysis-for-apple-health.html) to systematically improve my nutrition and activity habits

- [Digitizing and preserving old media](https://knightlab.film/) like 8mm film, VHS tapes, film negatives/positives, etc.

- Apps and various things through [KnightLab](https://knightlab.co)
