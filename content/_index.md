Hi there. I'm Scott Knight, a Data Automation Engineer in Houma, LA.

Having been a software & data engineer for some time I've realized that I like to keep things simple.

In creating this site as my own little slice of the internet, I have taken [inspiration from several sources](/inspiration/) in striving to keep this site as simple as practical.

## Work

Coming from a full-stack engineering background, I'm currently a Data Automation Engineer at [Sev1Tech](https://sev1tech.com). 

I also occasionally consult on technical projects and build fun things through [KnightLab](https://knightlab.co). Recently, KnightLab began branching out from the software world and is now offering [old media archival and digitization services](https://knightlab.film) as well.

I have a B.S. in Computer Science from Southeastern Louisiana University and an M.B.A. (hence the domain extension) in Entrepreneurship and Family Enterprise from Louisiana State University in Shreveport.

## Blog

In the [blog](/blog/) you'll find a collection of thoughts, resources, and other miscellaneous items which I've evidently deemed worthy of recording. 

Feel free to have a look around, you might find something interesting.
