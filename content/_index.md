Hi there. I'm a Data Automation Engineer in South Louisiana who enjoys tech, open data, cycling, and exploring outdoors.

Having written loads of complex software for clients through the years as a software & data engineer, I've come to enjoy keeping things simple and easy when it comes to my own projects. This site is a testament to that practice.

## Work

I work at [Sev1Tech](https://sev1tech.com).

I also consult on technical projects and build fun things through [KnightLab](https://knightlab.co). Recently, KnightLab began branching out from the software world and is now offering [old media archival and digitization services](https://knightlab.film) as well.

I have a B.S. in Computer Science from Southeastern Louisiana University and an M.B.A. (hence the domain extension) in Entrepreneurship and Family Enterprise from Louisiana State University in Shreveport.

## Blog

In the [blog](/blog/) you'll find an ever-growing collection of my thoughts, things I've learned, and interesting nuggets I find. Here are several of my most recent posts:
