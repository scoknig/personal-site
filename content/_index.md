Hi there. As you can see up there in the title, I'm Scott Knight. 

I'm a Data Automation Engineer in South Louisiana who enjoys tech, cycling, and the great outdoors.

Having written loads of complex software for clients through the years as a software & data engineer, I've come to enjoy practicing digital minimalism and keeping things simple when it comes to my own projects. This site is a testament to that.

## Work

I work at [Sev1Tech](https://sev1tech.com).

I also occasionally consult on technical projects and build fun things through [KnightLab](https://knightlab.co). Recently, KnightLab began branching out from the software world and is now offering [old media archival and digitization services](https://knightlab.film) as well.

I have a B.S. in Computer Science from Southeastern Louisiana University and an M.B.A. (hence the domain extension) in Entrepreneurship and Family Enterprise from Louisiana State University in Shreveport.

## Blog

In the [blog](/blog/) you'll find an ever-growing collection of my thoughts, things I've learned, and interesting nuggets I find.

If you use an RSS reader, [here's a link to the blog feed](/blog/index.xml).

Feel free to have a look around, you might find something interesting.
