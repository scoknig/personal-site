After several years of building apps, websites, and automations for clients, I've chosen to retire my freelance practice to focus on engineering and long-term projects. 

KnightLab may resurface someday in a new form, but for now I am no longer accepting new client engagements.

Many thanks to everyone I've had the privilege to build alongside through KnightLab.
