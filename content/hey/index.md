Hey, glad you stopped by.

If we connected at Cisco Live (chances are that we did and exchanged cards), thanks for taking the time. I always enjoy meeting people who are building smart systems, solving hard problems, and thinking about what's next.

My background spans data automation, software engineering, and business strategy. I'm especially interested in conversations that bridge tech with thoughtful execution, and am always open to swapping ideas, collaborating on innovative projects, or simply staying in touch with sharp folks in the industry.

So, let's stay connected:

- You can reach me via email: [scottk@hey.com](mailto:scottk@hey.com)
- Here's my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/imscottknight) if you'd like to connect there.

Looking forward to wherever the next conversation leads.
