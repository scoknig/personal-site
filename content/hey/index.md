Hi there, glad you stopped by.

We may have connected recently, or you might've just come across my card. 

I'm Scott Knight, a consultant and engineer with a background in data and process automation, intelligent systems, and business strategy. I enjoy building useful things, simplifying complexity, and collaborating with people who care about doing great work.

I'm especially interested in conversations that bridge tech with thoughtful execution and am always open to swapping ideas, collaborating on innovative projects, or simply staying in touch with sharp folks.

If you're exploring something interesting or just want to stay in touch, feel free to reach out:

- You can reach me via email: [scottk@hey.com](mailto:scottk@hey.com?subject=Quick%20hello)
- Here's my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/imscottknight) if you'd like to connect there.

Looking forward to wherever the next conversation leads.

--- Scott
