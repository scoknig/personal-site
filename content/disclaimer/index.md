### This is my personal website. The opinions expressed here are my own and not those of my current or any past employer.

&nbsp;

In addition, my opinions are subject to change from time to time. This is necessary for growth and keeping an open mind. 

This personal blog is intended to provide a semi-permanent snapshot of my thoughts, things I've learned, and interesting nuggets I find. As such, any thoughts and opinions expressed in previous posts may not persist to the current day.

As this site is meant to be a personal archive of sorts, I do not intend to go back and edit previous posts unless I notice a typo or update a technical post to reflect platform updates, etc.

Finally, I cannot be held liable for any damage to your systems, data, or anything else as a result of the content I create on this site. All technical procedures outlined on this site are provided as-is with no warranty whatsoever.
