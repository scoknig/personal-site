One of the fun parts of having your own website is that you can make it look however you want. I'm always tinkering with the designs, themes, and palettes of this site and I thought it'd be a fun ongoing project to keep an archive here using the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/web.php) from Internet Archive.
