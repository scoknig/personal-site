Hi there. I'm a Data Automation Engineer in South Louisiana with a curiosity for all things analog.

After years of building complex software for clients professionally, I've grown to appreciate simplicity and "touching grass" when I'm not working. Balance is important.

In my spare time I'm usually [reading](https://goodreads.com/scottknight), [streamlining workflows](/personal-automations/), spending time [outdoors](/through-the-woods/), collecting and restoring vintage typewriters and tobacco pipes, or periodically writing [here](/blog/) about my latest interests.

## Work

I work at [Sev1Tech](https://sev1tech.com).

I also consult on technical projects and build intelligent, data-driven systems that solve complex business problems.

I have a B.S. in Computer Science from Southeastern Louisiana University and an M.B.A. (hence the domain extension) in Entrepreneurship and Family Enterprise from Louisiana State University in Shreveport.

## Blog

In the [blog](/blog/) you'll find an ever-growing collection of my thoughts, things I've learned, and interesting nuggets I find. 

Here are several of my most recent posts:

Feel free to have a look around. I hope you find something interesting.
