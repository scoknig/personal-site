I'm Scott Knight, an engineer and builder drawn to useful work, clear thinking, and the lifelong pursuit of wisdom.

I spend my days working in complex systems and my spare time trying to simplify them — which could mean refining workflows, spending time outdoors, or studying ideas that have endured longer than any software ever will.

This site is where I write about what I'm building, learning, and anything else that strikes me. If you're interested in thoughtful work, small ventures, or enduring ideas, I hope you will find something useful here.

## Work

I work at [Sev1Tech](https://sev1tech.com).

I also consult on technical projects and build intelligent, data-driven systems that solve complex business problems.

I have a B.S. in Computer Science from Southeastern Louisiana University and an M.B.A. (hence the domain) in Entrepreneurship and Family Enterprise from Louisiana State University in Shreveport.

## Blog

In the [blog](/blog/) you'll find an ever-growing collection of my thoughts, things I've learned, and interesting nuggets I find.
