Some of the people and ideas that inspired me to make this site:

- [`zwbetz`](https://zwbetz.com) for his invaluable [Hugo tutorial](https://zwbetz.com/make-a-hugo-blog-from-scratch/#style-tweaks) and site design, which was emulated while learning Hugo to create this site

- [Suckless Software Philosophy](https://suckless.org/philosophy/)

- Karl Bartel's [Exercises in  Simplicity](https://www.karl.berlin/simplicity.html)

- [Kev Quirk](https://kevquirk.com/)

- [The 512K Club](https://512kb.club), a collective of performance-minded developers striving to make the internet less of a bloated mess (run by Kev Quirk)
