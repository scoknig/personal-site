An element of any good website/personal blog is that it allows readers to consume content in a variety of formats. That being said, I've spent some time debating on whether to add a way to subscribe via email, because I want to do it in a way that won't become a pain to maintain. I also don't want to maintain a separate newsletter that would require a manual copy/paste process.

I looked around at some other folks' blogs to see how they handled their email distros, and I think I've found a solution I like.

Using [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/refer/scottk), I'm able to have their system consume my existing [RSS Feed](/blog/index.xml) to populate an email template that will go out to the mailing list. This is great because it's all completely automated. So if you decide to subscribe, the only emails you'll receive from me are copies of my future posts.

A few notes on this:

- I combed through Buttondown's settings to ensure that there will be *no tracking*. I don't need it and you probably don't want it anyway.

- This is simply another way for you to receive my posts. The emails will only contain a copy of the post text and a link to the original web version when I publish a new blog post on this site.

- I will not send any other emails. No marketing rubbish, no product launches; just blog posts.

- As with the "Reply via email" button below all of my posts, you'll be able to reply to the Buttondown emails and I'll receive them so we can continue the conversation. Feel free to reach out any time.

If this all sounds good and you want my future posts sent right your inbox, you can sign up using the form below any blog post. 

Thanks for reading!
