I whipped up this site a while back with a few main goals in mind:

1. Establish a place on the web to publish my thoughts, useful/interesting bits of info I encounter, and generally [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) my content on the internet to break out of social media silos (check)

2. Learn a new platform to keep my web development skills from getting rusty (check)

3. Put out content that might be useful or interesting to other folks (check, hopefully)

My original design here has featured what would normally function as an "About" page as my actual [Home](/) page. Though, my thinking lately is that it may benefit readers to make my posts more easily accessible, since this is a main function of the site.

This change would require moving my Home page to an About page, which wouldn't be a huge effort but it would be one of the larger structural changes I made since publishing the initial version of this site.

Ultimately, while I think it makes sense to present first-time visitors with a blurb about myself, from a UX perspective this does force returning readers to click through at least two pages to access my newest post.

I'm thinking that moving my Home page content to an About page and featuring my post content up front would have the most net benefit. Readers would have an easier time getting to my posts and my bio content would still be there for those interested in it.

Do you have a preference when it comes to blog structure? Am I overthinking it? If you have any opinions on this, I'd like to know. Reply to this post via email and lets chat about it.
