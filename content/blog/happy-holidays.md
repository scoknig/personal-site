You may have noticed it's been quiet around here lately. No, the site's not abandoned and I haven't neglected to keep writing here; I'm just taking a break to enjoy the holiday season with family and friends. 

I'll be back to posting in 2024 with some new writings and whatever else I find worth discussing here.

So whatever your faith, practice, tradition, culture, or custom, I hope you make time to enjoy some earned rest and have a happy holiday season.
