It's almost fall, y'all. In the next few weeks we head into fall with the [Autumnal Equinox](https://www.almanac.com/content/first-day-fall-autumnal-equinox), which falls (no pun intended) on September 23, 2023.

Inspired by the impending fall season and the antiquarian philosophy books I've been reading lately, I felt like playing around with the site theme a bit. So, on this corner of the internet we're heading into fall a bit early with this new theme I'm calling "Library".

The rich leather and paper hues as well as the serif font are a nod to the warm, cozy ambiance of your favorite library reading nook.

You'll notice that I retained the dark-only theme. That's something I [don't plan to change](https://darktheme.club/), but I will continue to play around with the color palette and font elements from time to time. This theme in particular gives the site a fresh, distinguished academic look befitting the more philosophical content I've been reading and writing lately.
