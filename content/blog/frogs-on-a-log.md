There's an old story that goes something like this:

> There are five frogs sitting on a log. One decides to jump off. How many frogs are left on the log?

Most folks would answer, "one". But that's wrong.

The real answer is that *five frogs are still sitting on the log.*

You see, despite the *decision* to jump off, the story doesn't specify that the frog actually jumped. There is a vital distinction between making a decision and acting upon that decision. So, while that frog decided to jump, it didn't actually take the leap.

The metaphor of the five frogs on a log reminds us that our ideas, decisions, and aspirations are meaningless if we fail to back them up with action. 

In our lives, we often encounter situations where decisions simply aren't enough; we have to then bridge the gap between intention and execution.

So the next time you decide to do something worthwhile, don't be a frog on a log&mdash;take the leap.
