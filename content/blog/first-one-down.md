I probably picked the largest, most stressful item on my [24 in '24](/24-in-24) list to start with but I'm glad to update that I'm just getting settled into my new home. I had already planned to make a purchase in the first quarter of this year, and a great deal just happened to fall directly into my lap. So, I jumped on it and closed the deal at the beginning of this month.

I'm particularly proud of this accomplishment. I've worked tirelessly toward this and have cultivated a wealth of financial discipline to make this happen. It has definitely been a learning process, but I enjoyed the challenge and look forward to taking the next step in my investing career soon.

Now to press on with the rest of the list!
