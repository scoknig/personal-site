I recently wrote here about buying my new home. Since then, the experience has been slightly soured from a never-ending onslaught of predatory junk mail and door-knocking salespeople trying to swindle me into signing up for products or services I neither need nor want, targeting me as a new homeowner.

Many of them use fear-mongering tactics disguised as helpful advice, from mortgage warranty companies warning of natural disasters or my own death to security system salespeople making up stories about a "recent string of burglaries in my neighborhood".

What's worse, these exploitative and predatory practices are *completely legal*. My information was sold, traded, and exploited to bring these scammers right to my doorstep, which is at once unsettling and infuriating.

Already settling into a new mortgage, renovations/repairs, and unforeseen expenses, the last thing new homeowners need is predatory companies adding to the pressure.

If you're experiencing something similar, stay informed and don't fall for it.
