I've written here about my career in the software industry, but I'm also a big fan of analog technology. Digital stuff can be fun, but once you're ingrained in the tech world for so long and understand how it all (or, at least, most of it) works, it can lose a bit of its magic. For that reason I've always been drawn to the machines and devices of yesteryear.

One way I express that interest is through my collection of vintage and antique typewriters. I have a handful of them which I've picked up and restored to working condition over the years. I use them for all sorts of things like recording recipes, notes, letters, greeting cards; the uses are endless. The tactile action and sound of the clacking keys as you type makes using them fun, while simultaneously allowing you to slow down, think, and appreciate the process of writing.

A greatly helpful resource I've used to clean, restore, and maintain my typewriters is [Joe Van Cleave's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Joe_VanCleave). Joe's been making videos on vintage and analog tech since the 1980's and has *hundreds* of videos on just about anything to do with writing, typewriters (their usage, maintenance, collecting), and camera systems. Unfortunately, the number of people knowledgable about these machines is dwindling and it is increasingly hard to find good resources on restoring them. Thankfully, however, there are still folks like Joe who are doing their best to pass their knowledge along.

I admire Joe's consistency in creating useful content around something he's passionate about, and his bona fide wealth of knowledge shines throughout each video he posts. If you're into vintage/antique writing technology or just want to learn something interesting, check out Joe's videos.

P.S. It's been a busy couple of months so I haven't been posting as regularly. I'm hoping to get back to posting more frequently soon. *C'est la vie.*
