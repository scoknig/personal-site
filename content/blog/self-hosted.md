I've been browsing around for project ideas for an old [Dell Inspiron 15](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/dell-inspiron-15-7000-series-7559) I have laying around. The bones are great, but some of the keys don't work and the screen has some damage after being dropped on the ground at some point.

I want to keep it in use somehow, and my initial idea was to use it as a homebrew [NAS server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) using [TrueNas](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-core/).

Before committing to that, though, I decided to check out other self-hosted software out there in case there was something else I'd rather add to my home lab.

I came across the list below on Github and wanted to store it here for future reference. There's a ton of good stuff in there.
