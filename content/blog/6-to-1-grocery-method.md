While settling into my new home I've had to get back in the swing of grocery shopping and proper meal planning. And if there's one thing I've noticed, it's that it can be incredibly easy to get carried away at the grocery store and let the bill get out of hand. 

I recently came across a social media post (sorry, I don't remember the exact source to credit) outlining a method for grocery shopping I really like that helps prevent overspending while prioritize healthier ingredients, which is a win-win in my book. It's called the "6-to-1" method, which essentially goes as follows.

When you're grocery shopping, challenge yourself to stick to buying:

- 6 vegetables
- 5 fruits
- 4 proteins
- 3 starches
- 2 sauces
- 1 treat/snack

I like this because it's simple, easy to remember, and should leave you stocked up for the week with a healthy selection of meal options. Plus, it offers flexibility since there aren't specific quantities or items given for the categories.

Try it out and save yourself some dough :-)
