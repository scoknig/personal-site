Threads, the new app from Instagram (Meta), is designed to be a more "intimate and private" way to connect with your friends. It's free to use and there are no ads, which seem to be two of the main selling points. So far, though, I'm not convinced that it's enough to make me want to join.

First of all, let's talk about the privacy aspect. Instagram has a pretty [poor history](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/instagram-just-acknowledged-it-has-a-much-bigger-privacy-problem-than-we-thought.html) when it comes to privacy. They've been caught allowing their ad partners to collect and share loads of data from millions of user accounts without their consent, and have been criticized for their [lax security measures](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/09/12/new-instagram-hack-exclusive-facebook-confirms-user-accounts-and-phone-numbers-at-risk/?sh=1d369c4f2200). So I'm not sure why I should trust them with the intimate and private messages between me and my friends.

Secondly, even if Threads were completely private I'm not sure I see the point. Between the "[insert career here] has been killed by AI" and "I discovered X about [insert buzzword]. Here's what you should know..." posts, I'm already bored with the Twitter echo chamber. It's become a cesspool of people scrambling over each other to grab whatever clout they can get their grubby little fingers on. If Threads is supposed to be the "new Twitter", what would I gain by joining?

Finally, I suppose Threads is just another way for Meta to collect data on me and my digital interactions, which I'm not keen to support. As we know, if you're not paying for a product then you likely *are* the product (or maybe it's [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)).

As the Sharks say: for those reasons, I'm out. I'm not necessarily saying it's a bad app. I just don't think it's for me.

If you're looking for a more private way to connect with your friends, there are plenty of better options out there. [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) is a great secure messaging option. I'd also recommend [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/) as a federated alternative to Twitter. 

For now, you can [find me there](https://indieweb.social/@scoknig).
