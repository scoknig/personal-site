I'm perched atop a D.C. rooftop, enjoying a view of our majestic Capitol Dome. Unfortunately, what would otherwise be a fantastic view is unceremoniously interrupted by a colossal Apple billboard.

Noticing this, I can't help but appreciate the visual metaphor. The symbol of our nation, eclipsed by the relentless pursuit of profit.
