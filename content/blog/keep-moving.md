In February I decided to get more active and build better habits. I started small by purchasing a bike and committing to ride it at least three times per week.

Keeping this commitment to myself has naturally progressed into improving other aspects of my physical health---my nutrition and mindset have made leaps and bounds from where I was a year ago. As of today I've lost 57 lbs and counting, which really is just a byproduct of a lot of small life changes I've made over time.

I've still got a way to go before I hit my current goal weight but I know if I just keep doing what I'm doing indefinitely I'll get there *and* be able to sustain it, which is crucial to long-term success.

Everything I've done can be attributed to a single principle---energy balance. Eat less, move more. Make sure your energy output (i.e. movement, calories burned) is greater than your input (i.e. calories consumed). If you follow this rule, you *cannot* fail. It's basic science.

When I started cycling I was maxed out after 10 miles. As my endurance has improved over time, I've worked up to an average of 75mi/week with a single-trip max of 40 miles.

Unfortunately, I had a setback on my afternoon ride last Tuesday. 

I came around a curve on my route and before I could react I rolled over some debris in the road and caught a nail in my rear tire. Could be worse, but that means I'll be off the road until I can patch the tire and replace the inner tube.

Am I going to let that stop me? Nah. My backup strategy for things like this is to transition to a walking/running plan I've created for myself in the meantime. No excuses for equipment malfunction when I can just use my legs.

Gotta keep moving.

*P.S. I'm posting this because I've had a handful of folks ask me about what I've been doing to get the results that I have. I plan to compile some of my best tips & lessons learned in a separate post (coming soon) and will periodically publish updates along the way.*
