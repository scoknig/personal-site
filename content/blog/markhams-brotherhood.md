Markham</a><br/>
My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7087864075">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br /><br />
Markham's translation strikes a nice balance between accessibility and fidelity to the original texts, preserving the rich symbolism and profound spiritual teachings of the works while making them approachable to the modern reader.<br /><br />I appreciated Markham's choice to generally refrain from inserting personal interpretation, leaving that work to the reader. This approach allows for a more authentic engagement with the material, empowering readers to uncover their own insights within the many layers.<br /><br />Recommended for Rosicrucians and students of Western esotericism alike.
