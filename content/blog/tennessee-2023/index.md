For years, a favorite vacation spot of our family has been Tennessee. Yesterday I returned from a nice trip with some of my family to the Volunteer State, and thought I'd share a bit about it here.

## Home Base: Tracy City

I discovered Tracy City back in 2020 through a cabin I rented through AirBnb for another weekend getaway. I enjoyed it so much the first time that we decided to reserve another cabin on the property for this trip. 

Tracy City is a quiet little mountain town that was founded after a few local boys discovered coal while digging around after a groundhog. It has an interesting history and once even [elected a dead man as its mayor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_City,_Tennessee#Government).

Of the seven venues offered at [The Falls at Sewanee Creek](https://tnwaterfallgetaway.com/), we stayed in the [Log Cabin](https://tnwaterfallgetaway.com/log-cabin). The rental cabin sits on a sprawling and abundant landscape of about forty five acres, complete with its own nature trails, overlook, creek, and its focal point---a *private waterfall*. 

If you want a scenic and unique stay in south-central Tennessee, look no further. The hosts, Grant and Becky, will make sure you have everything you need (including a private tour of the grounds and welding lessons).

## Day 1: Chattanooga

Thursday we ventured out to Chattanooga to explore [Rock City](https://www.seerockcity.com/), a Tennessee tourist classic.

## Day 2: Lynchburg

Friday we drove over to Lynchburg with reservations for a tour and tasting at the [Jack Daniel's Whiskey Distillery](https://www.jackdaniels.com/). We also popped into the local [Lynchburg Winery](https://www.lynchburgwinery.com/) for a tasting.

## Day 3: Nashville

Saturday featured a trip up to Nashville, where we checked out [Antique Archaeology](https://www.antiquearchaeology.com/), home of the American Pickers from the History Channel show. Their shop is located in the old [Marathon Motor Works](https://www.marathonvillage.net/about/) car factory, which has a pretty neat museum inside as well.

After that, we headed to [Grimey's Record Shop](https://www.grimeys.com/) before finding a bite to eat.

## A Tip for Fellow Travelers

The next time you travel, consider exploring the smaller towns and spaces in between the usual tourist areas and beaten paths. These are where I always find the most fun, meaningful, and memorable stuff in my travels.
