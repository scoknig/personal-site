There's a ton of advice out there on personal finance, but I've only ever found one resource that provided an actionable path to gaining Financial Independence and Retiring Early (F.I.R.E.). Read more about that concept [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire).

It's a handy flow chart created by a member of the [r/financialindependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence) subreddit. Just within the last year this flow chart has helped me pay off nearly all debt, grow my net worth, and drastically increase my savings rate.

I wanted to save it here for quick reference, but if you live in the U.S. and want to retire early and/or become financially independent I recommend starting here.
